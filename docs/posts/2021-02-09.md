# Python Video Processing
{: .no_toc }

- Candidate python library: [Moviepy](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy)
- Current experiments: [Python Video Processing](https://github.com/aacayaco/python_video_processing)

## Goals

- [X] Load video from URL
- [X] Create a subclip
- [ ] Compression customization / output codec options
- [ ] Unit tests

## Learnings

- Need to explore more libraries but candidate library is stable and usable.
- Chunks are loaded for the subclip when writing the subclip - faster seek but save time will depend on subclip length and compression (codec).
